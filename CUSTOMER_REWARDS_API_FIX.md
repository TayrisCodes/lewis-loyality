# ðŸ”§ Customer Rewards API 404 Fix

## Problem Identified:
```
GET /api/customer/0936308836/rewards 404 in 14597ms
```

The customer dashboard was trying to fetch customer rewards from an endpoint that didn't exist.

## Root Cause:
The file `/app/dashboard/customer/page.tsx` was calling:
```typescript
const rewardsRes = await fetch(`/api/customer/${phone}/rewards`);
```

But the API endpoint `/api/customer/[phone]/rewards/route.ts` didn't exist.

## Fix Applied:

### 1. Created Missing API Endpoint âœ…
**New File**: `/app/api/customer/[phone]/rewards/route.ts`

**Features**:
- `GET /api/customer/[phone]/rewards` - Get customer rewards
- `POST /api/customer/[phone]/rewards` - Mark reward as used
- Populates store information for each reward
- Returns formatted reward data with status counts

### 2. Updated Middleware âœ…
**File**: `/middleware.ts`

**Changes**:
- Added `/api/customer/[phone]/rewards` to public API routes
- Added pattern matching for dynamic routes
- Now properly handles `/api/customer/0936308836/rewards` pattern

### 3. Cleaned Up Debug Logs âœ…
**File**: `/components/ui/sign-in-card-2.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Removed debug console.log statements
- Login is now working cleanly without debug output
