# Authentication & API Integration Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Token Storage Mismatch
- **Problem**: Backend set tokens as HTTP-only cookies, but frontend tried to use localStorage
- **Fix**: Updated frontend to use `credentials: 'include'` in all fetch calls
- **Fix**: Backend now returns token in JSON response AND sets it in cookies

### 2. Missing Credentials in Fetch Calls
- **Problem**: Frontend fetch calls didn't include cookies
- **Fix**: Created `ApiClient` utility that automatically includes credentials
- **Fix**: Updated all dashboard pages to use `ApiClient` instead of raw fetch

### 3. Login Response Mismatch  
- **Problem**: Backend didn't return token in JSON, frontend expected it
- **Fix**: Updated both `/api/super/auth/login` and `/api/admin/auth/login` to return token

### 4. No Route Protection
- **Problem**: No middleware to protect dashboard routes
- **Fix**: Created `middleware.ts` that:
  - Validates JWT tokens from cookies
  - Redirects unauthenticated users to login
  - Enforces role-based access control
  - Protects all `/dashboard/*` routes

### 5. No Client-Side Auth Validation
- **Problem**: Dashboard pages didn't check if user was authenticated
- **Fix**: Added `useEffect` hooks that:
  - Check authentication status using `AuthUtils`
  - Redirect to login if not authenticated
  - Handle 401 errors by clearing auth and redirecting

## Files Created

1. **`/lib/api-client.ts`** - Centralized API client with auth
   - `ApiClient` class with GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH methods
   - `AuthUtils` for managing client-side auth state
   - Automatic cookie inclusion in all requests
   - Logout functionality that clears both client and server

2. **`/middleware.ts`** - Next.js middleware for route protection
   - Token validation
   - Role-based access control
   - Automatic redirects for unauthorized access

3. **`/app/api/auth/logout/route.ts`** - Logout endpoint
   - Clears auth-token cookie
   - Supports both POST and GET methods

## Files Updated

### Backend
1. `/app/api/super/auth/login/route.ts` - Now returns token in response
2. `/app/api/admin/auth/login/route.ts` - Now returns token in response

### Frontend  
1. `/components/ui/sign-in-card-2.tsx` - Uses credentials: 'include'
2. `/components/dashboard/sidebar.tsx` - Uses AuthUtils for logout
3. `/app/dashboard/super/page.tsx` - Uses ApiClient, validates auth
4. `/app/dashboard/admin/page.tsx` - Uses ApiClient, validates auth

### Pages Still Need Update
The following pages still use old fetch patterns and should be updated:
- `/app/dashboard/super/stores/page.tsx`
- `/app/dashboard/super/admins/page.tsx`
- `/app/dashboard/super/settings/page.tsx`
- `/app/dashboard/admin/customers/page.tsx`
- `/app/dashboard/admin/visits/page.tsx`
- `/app/dashboard/admin/rewards/page.tsx`

## How It Works Now

### Login Flow
1. User submits login form
2. Frontend sends POST to `/api/super/auth/login` or `/api/admin/auth/login` with credentials: 'include'
3. Backend validates credentials
4. Backend generates JWT token
5. Backend sets token as HTTP-only cookie
6. Backend returns token + user info in JSON
7. Frontend stores user info (NOT token) in localStorage/sessionStorage
8. Frontend redirects to appropriate dashboard

### Authentication Check Flow
1. User navigates to dashboard
2. Middleware intercepts request
3. Middleware checks for auth-token cookie
4. Middleware verifies JWT token
5. If valid and role matches, allow access
6. If invalid, redirect to login

### API Request Flow
1. Dashboard makes API call using `ApiClient.get('/api/endpoint')`
2. ApiClient automatically includes `credentials: 'include'`
3. Server receives request with auth-token cookie
4. API route uses `requireAuth()` or `requireSuperAdmin()` to validate
5. If valid, process request
6. If invalid, return 401
7. Frontend catches 401, clears auth, redirects to login

### Logout Flow
1. User clicks logout
2. Frontend calls `AuthUtils.logout()`
3. AuthUtils sends POST to `/api/auth/logout`
4. Backend clears auth-token cookie
5. AuthUtils clears localStorage/sessionStorage
6. Redirects to `/login`

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Login as superadmin
- [ ] Access super admin dashboard - should work
- [ ] Try to access admin dashboard as superadmin - should redirect
- [ ] Logout
- [ ] Login as admin
- [ ] Access admin dashboard - should work
- [ ] Try to access super admin dashboard as admin - should redirect
- [ ] Logout
- [ ] Try to access dashboard without login - should redirect to login
- [ ] Login with "Remember me" - session should persist
- [ ] Login without "Remember me" - session should clear on browser close
- [ ] Make API calls from dashboard - should work with auth
- [ ] Invalid token should redirect to login

## Security Improvements

1. **HTTP-Only Cookies**: Token stored in HTTP-only cookie, not accessible by JavaScript
2. **SameSite**: Cookie set with `sameSite: 'strict'` to prevent CSRF
3. **Secure Flag**: Cookie secure flag enabled in production
4. **Token Expiry**: JWT tokens expire after 24 hours
5. **Role-Based Access**: Middleware enforces role-based access control
6. **Server-Side Validation**: All API routes validate auth server-side
